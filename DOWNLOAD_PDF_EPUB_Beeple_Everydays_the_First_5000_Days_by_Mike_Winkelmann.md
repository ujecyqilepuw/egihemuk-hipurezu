Overview
The first monograph on a digital art phenomenon Beeple: Everydays, the First 5000 Days is the first monograph dedicated to artist Mike Winkelman, aka Beeple, who is known for his daily digital creations: from twisted pop-culture caricatures to breathtaking sci-fi landscapes. Already a celebrity within the community of digital artists and on social media, Beeple became a global phenomenon on March 11, 2020, when Christieâ€™s sold a digital work of his for more than $69 million, launching the NFT (non-fungible token) craze. This monograph brings together Beepleâ€™s first 5,000 images, created and posted daily by the artist since May 2007, and also features an interview with the author wherein he reflects on his career and newfound celebrity.
