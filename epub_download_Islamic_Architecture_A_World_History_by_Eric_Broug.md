Overview
A richly illustrated history and sourcebook spanning the world of Islamic architecture. Islamic architecture is a broad topic, covering some 1,400 years up to the present day. The richness of building types, regional styles, and architectural details is reflected here, with a striking balance of familiar and unfamiliar, of world-renowned masterpieces and lesser-known gems. All eras and regions are represented, but with an eye for some of the creative exuberance, boldness, and sensitivity of Islamic architecture that has not been explored for a general readership until now. Eric Broug has an expert eye for the use of geometry and pattern, noting architectural elements that attend to specific regional, environmental, and climatic concerns. Providing a wealth of information about buildingsâ€™ historical and cultural contexts, Islamic Architecture is a richly packed visual sourcebook demonstrating the function and worldwide appeal of Islamic architecture. This book is essential for artists, designers, architects, and students of Islamic culture worldwide.
