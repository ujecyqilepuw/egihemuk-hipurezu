Overview
Deeply moving and authentic, this debut novel in verse follows teenage Evie through her eating disorder treatment and recoveryâ€•a perfect choice for readers of Wintergirls and Louder Than Hunger.
 
 Evie has just barely acknowledged that she has an eating disorder when sheâ€™s admitted to an inpatient treatment facility. Now her days are filled with calorie loading, therapy sessions, and longingâ€”for home, for control, and for the time before her troubles began. As the winter of her treatment goes on, she gradually begins to face her fears and to love herself again, with the help of caregivers and of peers who are fighting their own disordered-eating battles. This insightful, beautiful novel will touch every reader and offer hope and understanding to those who need it most.
